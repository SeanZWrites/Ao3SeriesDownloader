# Ao3 Series Downloader

A simple, open-source browser plugin that adds a 'Download Series' button in Ao3. Works in
Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.

*Note: You need to be logged into AO3 to see the Download Series button.*

## Installation Instructions
Ideally, you should install this from the Chrome Web Store (for Chrome) or the Mozilla Addons Site
(Firefox). However, it can also be sideloaded into the browser.

### Sideloading in Chrome
Once this extension is downloaded:
  - Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser
  - Enable developer mode by toggling the switch on the upper right.
  - Then click 'Load Unpacked', and navigate to this folder. 
  
You should see this extension appear.

### Sideloading in Firefox
Firefox does not allow sideloading in normal releases, so you'll need to use either the Developer
Edition, or a nightly build. Additionally, you'll need to re-do this process every time you load
Firefox (hence why installing it from the official store is recommended). 

However, if you'd like to test the extension, or just load it without using the store:
  - Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
  - Click 'Load Temporary Add-on...'
  - Navigate to where you downloaded these files, and select any file in the folder. 

The extension will be loaded into Firefox until you close the browser.
